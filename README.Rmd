This package is a continuation of the [Polars R package](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars) version 0,
intended as a mitigation for the too many breaking changes from Polars R package version 0 to 1.

There are no plans for active feature additions or bug fixes in this package,
so it is recommended to migrate to the new version of the Polars R package if possible.

We can trace the history of this package back to the original Polars R package,
with the following steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rpolars/r-polars0.git
pushd r-polars0
git remote add r-polars https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars.git
git fetch r-polars v0
git replace 03f3f689df98788455d233806ab9a5e984bc35f2 a37bc3422d1a0d334b068cdf137b5ee77e210163
```

## Install

This package can be installed from the R-universe rpolars repository.

```r
Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
install.packages("polars0", repos = "https://rpolars.r-universe.dev")
```
