This package is a continuation of the Polars R package version 0,
intended as a mitigation for the too many breaking changes from Polars R package version 0 to 1.

We can trace the history of this package back to the original Polars R package,
with the following steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rpolars/r-polars0.git
pushd r-polars0
git remote add r-polars https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars.git
git fetch r-polars
git replace 03f3f689df98788455d233806ab9a5e984bc35f2 a37bc3422d1a0d334b068cdf137b5ee77e210163
```
